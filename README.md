## 💾 Installation

### Option 1: Download DMG

> **Note**: AskRepo is not code-signed because I don't have an Apple Developer account (it costs $99/year). I developed this app for personal use and decided to share it with the community. When you download it, macOS will show a security warning.

1. Download the latest [AskRepo.dmg](https://github.com/ninjiez/askrepo/releases/latest)
2. Open the DMG file
3. Drag AskRepo to your Applications folder
4. **Fix the security warning** by opening Terminal and running:
   ```bash
   cd /Applications
   xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine AskRepo.app
   ```
5. Launch AskRepo from Applications or Spotlight

Alternatively, if you prefer to build from source (which avoids the security warning), see Option 2 below.

### Option 2: Build from Source (No Security Warnings)

Building from source avoids all security warnings since the app runs locally without quarantine flags.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/ninjiez/askrepo.git
cd askrepo

# Build the app and create DMG
./build.sh        # Creates the .app bundle
./build-dmg.sh    # Creates the DMG installer

# Or run directly
swift run

# Or open in Xcode
open Package.swift
```

### Requirements
- **macOS 13.0** or later
- **Xcode 15.0** or later (for building from source)
